# Installing

Do you have to use `composer` to install this library. If you don't know what composer is, please take a look at
[composer official site](https://getcomposer.org).

With all properly installed you have to run the following command to start to be strict.

```sh
composer require roave/strict-php
```

That's pretty much it.
